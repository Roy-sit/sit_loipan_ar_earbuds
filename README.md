#### Element
1. Hotspot Elements: Placed clickable hotspots within the model that display annotations when clicked.
2. Hotspot Styling: Used custom styles for hotspots such as circular borders, shadows, hover effects, and visible/invisible toggling based on user interactions.
3. Event Handling: Added click event listeners to hotspots so that clicking displays the information related to each hotspot.
4. Click Outside to Close hotspots: Enabled a feature to close the annotation if users click outside the hotspot, improving user experience.
5. Annotation Toggling: Implemented a function to show/hide annotations.
